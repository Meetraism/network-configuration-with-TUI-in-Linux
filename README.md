# Description: 

In this project we provide a TUI interface for user to configure his/her own linux network configuration. I tried to make it convenient, flexible and easy to use for you as a network administrator!
So good for you! Experience a seamless UI/UX. You don't need to be involved with dozens of commands. Complexity is handled behind the scene!

# There ar two scope of configuration in this application:

1. General Configuration: 
	+ Change hostname
	+ Change DNS server
	+ Assign IP to an interface
	+ Add/remove static routes

2. Configure your own Firewall configuration! 
	+ In this part we dive into NFtables as much as possible.
	  (NFtables is a modern packetfiltering framework in linux-based hosts.)
